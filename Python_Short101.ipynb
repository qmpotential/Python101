Python supports several numeric data types, including integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and complex numbers (complex). Integers represent whole numbers without decimals, floats represent real numbers with decimals, and complex numbers include both real and imaginary parts. Python automatically manages the size of integers, allowing them to grow beyond typical limits found in other languages. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported across all numeric types, and conversion between them is straightforward using built-in functions like int(), float(), and complex(). This flexibility makes Python particularly powerful for scientific computing, data analysis, and mathematical modeling."

The floor division operator returns the integer quotient of a division, discarding any remainder, and the modulus operator returns the remainder of a division. Exponentiation raises a number to the power of another, such as 2 ** 3 producing 8.

For example, x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5. These operators make code more concise and efficient by updating variable values directly without repeating the variable name."

Python provides built-in functions for casting between common types such as int(), float(), str(), and bool().

Type casting is particularly useful when performing operations that require specific data types, such as mathematical calculations or string concatenations.

        "A dictionary in Python is an unordered, mutable collection of key–value pairs used to store and retrieve data efficiently. Each key in a dictionary must be unique and immutable (such as a string, number, or tuple), while the values can be of any data type and may be duplicated. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {} with keys and values separated by colons, for example: {\"name\": \"Oleg\", \"age\": 25}. Data in a dictionary can be accessed, modified, or deleted using the key name rather than an index, making them ideal for structured data representation. Because of their flexibility and fast lookup performance, dictionaries are widely used for mapping, configuration, and data manipulation in Python programs."

        "An if statement in Python is a conditional control structure used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to True. It allows a program to make decisions and respond differently based on given inputs or situations. The general syntax uses the if keyword followed by a condition and a colon (:), with the indented block below representing the code to run when the condition is true. Optionally, elif (short for “else if”) and else clauses can be added to handle multiple or alternative conditions. For example, an if statement can be used to check user input, compare variable values, or control program flow based on logical expressions."

It is often used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a logical condition rather than a fixed range. The loop checks the condition before each iteration, and if it evaluates to False, the loop terminates. To prevent infinite loops, it’s important to ensure that something inside the loop eventually makes the condition False. Optionally, the break statement can be used to exit the loop early, and the continue statement can skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next cycle."

They help organize programs into smaller, manageable sections, improving readability, reusability, and maintainability. Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by a name, parameters (optional), and a block of code. They can accept inputs (arguments) and optionally return a value using the return statement. Python also supports features like default parameters, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), recursion, and anonymous functions using lambda. Overall, functions are essential for writing structured and efficient Python programs."
